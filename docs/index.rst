:mod:`nlpnet` --- Natural Language Processing with neural networks
==================================================================

:mod:`nlpnet` is a Python library for Natural Language Processing tasks based on neural networks. 
Currently, it performs part-of-speech tagging and semantic role labeling. It may be used as a Python
library or through its standalone scripts. Most of the architecture is language independent, 
but some functions were especially tailored for working with Portuguese.

This system was inspired by SENNA_, but has some conceptual and practical differences. 
If you use :mod:`nlpnet`, please cite one or both of the articles below, according to your needs (POS or
